I did a little bit of research on this item, and after one thing led to another, I found the lovely Facebook profile of the manufacturer. I sent them a perfectly harmless message telling them how cute they look and how I love the lighting of their bedroom (it was hard to see from the bushes though). Anyway, this $%!#ing PSYCHO then called the POLICE. Can you believe that? Absolutely unprofessional!",
